# Validation Backend

## What It does

It receives the HTTP-Requests from the validation-app. It has simple CRUD functionality to manage the coupon codes.

### What I learned

I learned to create a simple REST-API with Node.js + Express. In Addition I added some tests for testing the API. As a database I used MongoDB.
